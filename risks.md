# Potential Security Risks of Open Ports Found in Network Scan

- Port 22 (SSH): 
  Secure remote login. Risk of brute-force attacks if weak passwords are used.  
  Mitigation: Use strong passwords, enable key-based authentication, and limit login attempts.

- Port 135 (MSRPC):  
  Microsoft RPC service used for Windows networking.  
  Risk: Can be exploited for remote code execution or privilege escalation if not patched.  
  Mitigation: Keep Windows systems updated and firewall restrict access.

- Port 445 (Microsoft-DS / SMB):  
  Used for file sharing on Windows networks.  
  Risk: Common target for ransomware attacks like WannaCry and EternalBlue exploit.  
  Mitigation: Patch regularly and disable SMBv1 if not needed.

- Port 5432 (PostgreSQL):  
  Database service.  
  Risk: If exposed to the internet without authentication, can be vulnerable to unauthorized access.  
  Mitigation: Restrict access to trusted IPs and enforce strong authentication.

- Port 8000 (HTTP-alt):  
  Alternative HTTP port, often for web apps or admin panels.  
  Risk: Could expose web services with vulnerabilities if unpatched or misconfigured.  
  Mitigation: Keep web services updated and restrict access.

- Port 8088 (Radan HTTP):  
  Possibly a custom or proprietary web service.  
  Risk: Unknown vulnerabilities if service is unmaintained or poorly secured.  
  Mitigation: Investigate service purpose and secure or disable if unnecessary.

- Port 8089 (Unknown):  
  Not a standard port, likely custom or development service.  
  Risk: Could be a weak point if unsecured or running outdated software.  
  Mitigation: Identify the service and secure or close if not required.

General Recommendations:

- Close any unused ports and disable unnecessary services.  
- Use firewalls to limit access to critical services.  
- Regularly update all software and services.  
- Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
